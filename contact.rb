When you define a field, you need to provide the name of the column as a symbol,
and then the data type the field will store. :string should be straightforward, but
:text maybe not so much. Basically you can store more characters in a
 :text field than a :string field,which is limited to 256 characters.
 (You might want to write an extensive file on each contact!)

  field :email,      as: :string
  field :note,       as: :text


  def full_name(fist_name, last_name)
      return "#{first_name} #{last_name}"
  end

Ensuring the database connection is closed
By default, SQLite allows 5 concurrent connections. Unfortunately,
there won't be any connections left and you'll get a mysterious Timeout error.
